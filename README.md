# Interactive Educational Content Delivery System for Rural Chhattisgarh

## Project Overview
This project targets enhancing the quality of education in Deurbal, Chhattisgarh. Through the development of a user-friendly software, it aims to integrate interactive and engaging online content with traditional teaching methodologies, focusing on peer learning and technology-based engagement.

## Challenges & Solutions
The prevalent perception among village residents of the limited value in education beyond agricultural work led to low school attendance rates and educational quality. To counter this, the project proposed:
- A mentoring scheme for peer learning.
- Technology-based learning content to maintain student engagement.

## The Team
- **Project Guides**: Dr. Maneesha Ramesh, Dr. Maya Menon, and others from the School of Engineering, alongside international partners from the University of Manchester, U.K.
- **Amrita Partner**: Department of Computer Science and Engineering team, including Pragnavi Ravuluri Sai Durga and others.
- **Village Engagement**: In Deurbal, Chhattisgarh, involving direct interaction and feedback from the community.

## Implementation & Impact
- The software, demonstrated through `recorder.py`, enables dynamic session recording and easy content distribution on accessible devices.
- Field testing and feedback collection showed positive effects on school attendance and engagement, with technology and mentoring recognized as key enhancers.

## How to Use
1. Set up the environment as per Python standards.
2. Run `recorder.py` to initiate the software functionalities designed for educational content delivery.
